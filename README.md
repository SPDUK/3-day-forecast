## Dev Setup

- Install [Node.js latest LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- Install [Yarn package manager v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- Install [VSCode ESLint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)


## Dev settings

Check the `.vscode/settings.json` file to see the repo dev settings, a TL;DR is that it will use ESLint to format code on save to ensure it's formatted correctly.

Check the `.eslintrc` file to see ESLint settings - this repo is using [wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos) which is an ESLint setup that includes prettier formatting styles.
